# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
# I am proud of remembering the methods that we have learned so far, such as pop, push, concat, etc. I hope to keep adding on these methods to my memory bank, although I am confident that I will be googling these methods going forward in real life scenarios.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
# Methods are one of the most powerful ways to add efficiency to our work as coders. Because these methods already contain the instructions/code that we would otherwise have to write, every time we want to do some job, they provide a shortcut for us to utilize.
